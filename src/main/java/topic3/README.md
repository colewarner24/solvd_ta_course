# Topic 3 Questions

# 1. What is an interface?
It is a reference type of class that only contains method signatures and constants.
It is a contract that the class must implement all the methods in the interface.
# 2. What is static?
Static is a keyword that means the method or variable belongs to the class and not the instance of the class.
# 3. Can we call non-static methods from static? Vice versa?
You cannot call non-static methods from a static method because the non-static method belongs to the instance of the class.
You can call static methods from a non-static method.
# 4. 6 differences between an abstract class and an interface?
An abstract class can have constructors, fields, and methods with implementation. An interface cannot have any of these.
An abstract class can have both abstract and non-abstract methods. An interface can only have abstract methods.
An abstract class can have fields while an interface can only have constants.
An interface cannot have private and protected access modifiers. An abstract class can have all access modifiers.
A class can only extend one abstract class but can implement multiple interfaces.
interfaces should be used as a contract while abstract classes should be used as a class blueprint.
# 5. What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism is the OOP principle that allows a class to have multiple forms. Subclasses can override and share the same method name as the superclass.
# 6. What is final?
The final keyword states that the method or variable cannot be modified in a subclass.
# 7. What is functional programming?
Functional programming is the programming model where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.
# 8. What are the differences between OOP and functional programming?
OOP is based on objects and classes while functional programming is based on functions.
OOP is stateful while functional programming is stateless.
OOP focuses more on data while functional programming focuses more on behavior.
